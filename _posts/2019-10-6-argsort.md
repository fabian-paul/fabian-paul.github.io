title: numpy argsort incantations

"You seem to be a big fan of the numpy.argsort method, Fabian, since you recommand it so frequently...", my collage Raj approached me last Friday in the lab.

So I lowered my voice and replied in conspiratorial whisper: Well, you know, numpy works a little bit like magic. Once you call a operation by its [true name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_name), it just comes true.

So I'm going to reveal some arcane abras and cadabras that every numpilogist should know about.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/wizard-2021410_640.jpg)

Let's create some artifial data to illustrate how argsort can be used.

```Python
import numpy as np
np.set_printoptions(precision=2)
N = 10
data = 100*np.random.rand(N)
```

```Python
data
>>> array([77.09,  2.78, 79.87, 57.14, 89.41, 70.59,  9.51,  0.53, 98.36,
       87.73])
```

The primary usage of argsort (before we venture into the deeper territrories of numpilogy) is to sort the array that is given as its argument. But instead of returning the sorted array, `argsort` returns a list of indices that can be used to sort the array.
I like to call this return value the `order` of things.

```Python
order = np.argsort(data)
order
>>> array([7, 1, 6, 3, 5, 0, 2, 9, 4, 8])
```

In numpy, integers array can be used as indices to another array.
If we index `data` with `order`, we obtain the sorted array.

```Python
data[order]
>>> array([ 0.53,  2.78,  9.51, 57.14, 70.59, 77.09, 79.87, 87.73, 89.41,
       98.36])
```

Now observe that `order` is list of non-repeating integers between 0 and len(data)-1. [Obviously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle), the function ] $$i\rightarrow\text{order}[i]$$ must then be a bijection (one-to-one and onto) and therfore possess an inverse.

How can one find this inverse? And what are its uses? Let's first try to answer the first question.

Generally speaking, for a list of intergers `forward_map` the inverse `inverse_map` can be defined by one of the identities

```Python
inverse_map[forward_map] = identity
forward_map[inverse_map] = identity
```

In our application to ordering and sorting, `identity` is the list `l` of numbers with `l[i]=i`. 
That is `indentity=np.arange(N)`.

Continuing with the application to sorting, we seek `inverse_order` such that
```Python
order[inverse_order] = np.arange(N)
```
Note that `identity` is an ordered list and contains the same integers as `order` (but in a different order). Now from what we have learned above, we know that the list of indices that sorts the elements of `order` is `np.argsort(order)`. Therfore

```Python
inverse_order = np.argsort(order)
inverse_order
>>> array([5, 1, 6, 3, 8, 4, 2, 0, 9, 7])
```

It's easy to check the two identities:

```Python
print(order[inverse_order])
print(inverse_order[order])
```
```
[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
```

Now that we have found the inverse_order, why is it useful? To see this let's go back to the step, where we actually produce the sorted data:

```Python
sorted_data = data[order]
sorted_data
>>> array([ 0.53,  2.78,  9.51, 57.14, 70.59, 77.09, 79.87, 87.73, 89.41,
       98.36])
```

Now instead of having the indexing operation data[order] on the right-hand side of the assignment operation, numpy also allows to have the indexing operation on the left-hand side of the assignment.

```Python
sorted_data = np.empty_like(data)
sorted_data[order] = data
sorted_data
>>> array([70.59,  2.78,  9.51, 57.14, 98.36, 89.41, 79.87, 77.09, 87.73,
        0.53])
```

Obviously something is wrong here, despite the operation being syntactially correct. As you already will have guessed, moving order to the other side of the equation requires to take its inverse. The correct solution is

```Python
sorted_data = np.empty_like(data)
sorted_data[inverse_order] = data
sorted_data
>>> array([ 0.53,  2.78,  9.51, 57.14, 70.59, 77.09, 79.87, 87.73, 89.41,
       98.36])
```

Writing this in mathematical form might make a little clearer what is going on. I abbreviate `data` by $$d$$, `sorted_data` by $$s$$, and `order` by $$\sigma$$. Rewriting `sorted_data[order] = data` in this short form gives:

$$ s(i) = d(\sigma(i)) \text{ for all } i$$

Now define $$ j = \sigma(i) $$ that is equivalent to $$ i = \sigma^{-1}(j) $$. Substituting $$j$$ for $$i$$, we obtain

$$ s(\sigma^{-1}(j)) = d(j) \text{ for all } j$$

#### Apprentice's exercise:
As a small note on the side, there exists a more direct algorithm for converting the order
into it inverse which runs in linear time. Can you program it?

`np.arsgort` has $$N \log N$$ time complexity and 
is therefore a little less efficient than the direct solution. Still I like the 
convenience of numpy in providing a single function that carryies out the conversion for me.

#### Dicussion

Finally, let me discuss why such numpilogical contortions can in fact be useful. Sometimes, putting the indexing operation on the left-hand side can be super convenian, like in the following:
```Python
processed_data[chunk_indices, :] = data_chunk
```
Imagine that `processed_data` is a very large array that stores all your results and that you don't want to hold twice in RAM. Maybe you have broken down a large computation into multiple function calls (possibly using multiprocessing). Assume that `processed_data` must hold the 
results in a specific order that you specified in advance.  In this case, you need to insert 
the data chunk into `processed_data` at the correct location.  For this is useful to be able  to convert "right-hand side" indices to "left-hand side" indices. This is especially appealing if there is already a numpy function that works like a charm.
